    The lab will be recruiting PhD students (through Oxford PhD programs)
    and postdocs (preferably through fellowships we can write together).

    I know joining a brand-new lab has some uncertainties - the daily running of the 
    lab hasn't been established, and there aren't any current lab members 
    to ask how things are going. I can say that I'm dedicated towards helping
    my trainees build good foundations and accomplish their individual goals, 
    and I'm looking forward to the starting team establishing the lab together.

    If you're interested in the lab, feel free to drop me an email.
