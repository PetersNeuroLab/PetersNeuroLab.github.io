<div class="announcementbox">
    <p> We're hiring!</p>
</div>

<p>
    We're a brand-new lab looking for a team that's excited about neuroscience,
    focused on putting out good research, and ready to help establish
    our science from the ground-up.
</p>
<p>
    There are a lot of unique rewards and challenges in joining a new lab,
    since starting members will help get the lab up and running. I'm
    dedicated towards making this a collaborative process: I want my
    trainees to build good foundations and accomplish their invidual goals,
    and I want to continually improve my mentorship.
</p>
<p>
    Projects can be flexible related to the themes of the lab:
    <ul>
        <li>Interactions between the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus</li>
        <li>Changes in activity over learning</li>
        <li>Mechanisms of behavior/action/motor control</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    If you're interested in joining the lab, feel free to send me an informal email.
</p>


<h4>Postdocs</h4>
<p>
Postdocs would ideally have experimental experience in electrophysiology
or imaging, substantial coding experience, and a previously published
first-author paper. The goal for postdocs is to come in ready to do
science, and for me to help them publish successful projects
and hit their career objectives. We'll plan on starting postdoctoral fellowship
applications before you arrive to develop project ideas, help build
your CV, and contribute some money to the lab. I likely can't accept
a postdoc before ~October 2023 without a fellowship, but I can accept
a postdoc with a fellowship any time.
</p>


<h4>Doctoral students</h4>
<p>
Doctoral students don't need extensive experience, though lab and
coding experience is ideal. The goal for doctoral students is to come in
ready to learn, and for me to help them develop the skills
to be a scientist. We can take students from these doctoral programs:

</p>

<h4>Masters students</h4>
<p>
Masters students don't need experience, just excitment about starting out
doing research. The goal is for masters students to accomplish
a small project that gives them a realistic experience of how science
is done.
</p>

<h4>Undergraduate students</h4>
<p>
We may be able to take in undergraduate students to get exposure to
research and (depending on what's going on in the lab) help out with
projects. Undergraduates can shadow (short-term) or work with a student
or postdoc in the lab who would benefit from extra help, so availability
depends on current projects.
