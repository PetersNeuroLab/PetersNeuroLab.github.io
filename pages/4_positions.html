<p>
    We're a brand-new lab, and I'm looking forward to building a team
    to help establish the lab together. I'm dedicated towards helping
    my trainees build good foundations and accomplish their individual goals, 
    and I will strive to continually improve my mentorship.
</p>    
<p>
    I'm happy to develop project ideas together that fit the themes of the lab:
    <ul>
        <li>Interactions between the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus</li>
        <li>Changes in activity over learning</li>
        <li>Mechanisms of behavior/action/motor control</li>
    </ul>
    If you're interested in the lab, feel free to drop me an email.
