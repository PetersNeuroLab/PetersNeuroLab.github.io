        Andy grew up outside of Philadelphia and bounced around the US
        before coming to the UK. He got his PhD in Takaki Komiyama's lab
        at UC San Diego studying motor cortex activity over learning, 
        then moved to the Matteo Carandini & Kenneth Harris' lab at
        University College London for a postdoc to study interactions
        between the cortex and striatum. In his free time he likes playing
        drums (less often) and mandolin (more often but worse).
