        Andy grew up outside of Philadelphia and bounced around the US
        before coming to the UK. He got his PhD in the Komiyama Lab
        at UC San Diego studying motor cortex activity over learning, 
        then moved to the Carandini & Harris Lab at
        University College London for a postdoc to study interactions
        between the cortex and striatum. He likes playing music (drums
        and mandolin) and hiking in good weather.
