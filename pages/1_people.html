        Patterns of summed activity are matched between topographically
        connected regions of the cortex and striatum, changing only in 
        gain with learning. This suggests cortical activity propagates 
        through the striatum untransformed but more effectively
        after learning, which provides clues towards uncovering
        the functions and mechanisms of the basal ganglia.
