        Andy grew up outside of Philadelphia and bounced around the US
        before coming to the UK. He got his PhD in the Komiyama Lab
        at UC San Diego studying motor cortex activity over learning, 
        then moved to the Carandini & Harris Lab at
        University College London for a postdoc to study interactions
        between the cortex and striatum. He likes playing music (drums
        and mandolin) and hiking in good weather.

    <h4>Julie Fabre</h4>
    <h5>PhD student collaborator (at UCL)</h5>
    <p>
        Julie is a Wellcome Trust PhD student in the Harris/Carandini 
        lab at UCL, co-supervised by Andy. She studies how sensory 
        information is shaped by learned associated movements in the 
        basal ganglia. Julie originally studied medicine in France 
        before transitioning to neuroscience at the École normale 
        supérieure in Paris, and then moving to London to complete 
        her PhD. She loves cycling and recently pedalled along the whole 
        coast of Britany. Next up, London-Paris!
