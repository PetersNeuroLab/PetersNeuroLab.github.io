<p>
    The Peters Lab will be opening in the Oxford University
    <a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics</a>
</p>

<p>
    We're interested in the relationship between brain activity and behavior,
    and study how activity flows between regions and changes with learning to guide movement.
</p>
<p>
    In particular, we're focused on the loop between the cortex, basal ganglia, 
    and thalamus. These structures work together to learn and execute behavior, 
    but we don't have a good understanding of how they do this.
</p>
<p>
    We investigate these questions using the full modern toolbox 
    for systems neuroscience to record and manipulate activity
    in mice performing simple tasks, including:
