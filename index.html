    The Peters Lab will be opening in the Oxford University
    <a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics</a>
</p>

<p>
    We're interested in how activity in the brain drives behavior: 
    How does activity in different brain regions relate to movement? 
    How does activity flow and change between brain regions to funnel
    information from the outside (or inside) world into action?
    How is activity in the brain shaped by learning to adapt or
    develop behaviors?
</p>
<p>
    We're particularly focused on the loop between the cortex, basal
    ganglia, and thalamus: these structures work together to learn 
    and execute behavior, but it's a very open question how they do this.
</p>
<p>
    We investigate these questions using the full modern toolbox 
    for systems neuroscience to record and manipulate activity
    in mice performing simple tasks, including:
