<p>
    COMING FALL 2022:
    The Peters Lab will be opening in the Oxford University
    <a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics</a>,
    we'll be looking for both PhD students (through Oxford PhD programs)
    and postdocs (preferably through fellowships we can write together).

    We'll just be boxes for a little while, but if you're interested, 
    feel free to drop me an email.
