<h2><u>COMING FALL 2022</u></h2>

<p>
    The Peters Lab will be opening in the Oxford University
    <a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics</a>
</p>

<p>
    We'll be looking for both PhD students (through Oxford PhD programs)
    and postdocs (preferably through fellowships we can write together).
    We'll just be boxes for a little while, but if you're interested, 
    feel free to drop me an email.
</p>
